{"name":"shinyGC","tagline":"Shiny apps for my statistics classes","body":"## Shiny Apps for Teaching (Georgetown College)\r\n\r\nThis repository is a collection of Shiny apps teaching, mostly in introductory statistics classes for non-majors.  It is posted here for easy deployment to the College Shiny Server, and for to provide examples for colleagues to use and modify.\r\n\r\nSome apps were written a while back when I was just learning my way around Shiny.  They will be re-factored someday; in the meantime I don't recommend emulating their coding strategies.\r\n\r\nReasonably good code can be found in:\r\n\r\n* CIMean (explore confidence interval using simulation)\r\n* FindRegLine (regression line game that records students' scores)\r\n* GetToKnow (survey app, souped up with Google maps and basic descriptive statistics)\r\n\r\nA tutorial on writing Shiny teaching apps can be found at:\r\n\r\n[http://homer.shinyapps.io/sim_tutorial_Rmd](http://homer.shinyapps.io/sim_tutorial_Rmd)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
