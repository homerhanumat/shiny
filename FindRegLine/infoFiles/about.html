<h2>Determining the Score</h2>
<div id="the-y-bar-line." class="section level3">
<h3>The y-bar Line.</h3>
<p>Given a set of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> points on a
scatter plot:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),\ldots,(x_n,y_n),\]</span></p>
<p>the <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span>-line is defined to
be the horizontal line whose y-intercept is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar{y} = \frac{\sum_{i = 0}^{n}
y_i}{n},\]</span></p>
<p>the mean of the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-coordinates of
the points on the scatter plot. Of all horizontal lines, it’s the one
that “best fits” the scatter plot, in the sense that you would use it to
predict the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-value of an
observation if you were not allowed to take its <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-value into account.</p>
<p>When you begin a game, the <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span>-line is drawn for you.</p>

<div id="error-sum-of-squares" class="section level3">
<h3>Error Sum of Squares</h3>
<p>For any line <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> with equation
<span class="math inline">\(y = a + bx\)</span>, we define the <em>error
sum of squares</em> (ESS for short) of the line as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ESS_{l} = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} (y_i - (a + b
x_i))^2.\]</span></p>
<p>When you play the app, the ESS for the line you have at any given
moment is the sum of the squares of the vertical lines (drawn on the
plot) between the given data points and your line.</p>
<p>The regression line has the interesting property of being the line
that makes the ESS as small as possible. If your line has an ESS equal
to that of the regression line, then it <em>is</em> the regression
line!</p>
<p>When you play the game, your “closeness measure” is determined by the
following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{closeness} = \frac{ESS_{\text{your
current line}} - ESS_{\text{the regression
line}}}{ESS_{\bar{y}\text{-line}} - ESS_{\text{the regression line}}}
\times 100.\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, the closeness measure computes how close your current line
comes to the regression line with how close the <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span>-line is to the regression line.
This comparison is multiplied by 100 so that you can think of it as a
percentage. When the game begins your line <em>is</em> the <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span>-line, so the closeness measure is
100%.</p>
<p>Your score at any moment is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Score} = \text{number of turns so
far} + \text{current closeness measure}.\]</span></p>

<div id="suggestions" class="section level2">
<h2>Suggestions</h2>
<p>It’s often a good idea to work first with the slider that determines
the slope. Once you think you have the slope about right, use the
intercept-slider to move the line up or down horizontally. You won’t get
a new score report until you submit, but you can move the line around as
much as you like before committing yourself to a submission.</p>
<p>Can you think of a situation where it is in your best interests to
stop? (<strong>Hint: </strong> Each additional submission costs you an
extra point.)</p>
