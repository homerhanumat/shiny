Students can:\n\n* choose from four different populations (two of which are quite pathological)\n* choose a sample size\n* choose a nominal level of confidence\n\nThey can also have the app take a designated number of samples at once.\n\n* Taking one sample at a time helps reinforce the distinction between sample and population.\n* Taking many samples gives a good estimate of the actual level of confidence.\n\nOther Features\n=====================\nincremental:  true\n\n* A separate tab takes fifty samples at a time.  This helps students get a feel for situations in which the intervals are liable to miss on a particular \"side\" of the mean.\n* A third tab compares the theoretical t-curve with the a data-based estimate of the actual distribution of the t-statistic used to construct t-intervals.  This helps students understand the effect of departures from model assumptions.\n* A fourth tab reminds students of confidence interval principles and explains how to use the app.\n\n\n",
