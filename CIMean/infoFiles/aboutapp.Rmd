This app was written by Homer White:  <http://github.com/homerhanumat>.  It features in a tutorial that I wrote on developing simulation apps in Shiny.  The tutorial is in the form of an interactive R Markdown document.  If you would like to view it, simply clone my repo:

into your own computer, locate the (awkwardly-named) file `sim_tutorial_Rmd/tutorial_sim.Rmd`, open it in R Studio and click Run Document.
