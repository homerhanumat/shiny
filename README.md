## Shiny Apps for Teaching (Georgetown College)

This repository is a collection of Shiny apps teaching, mostly in introductory statistics classes for non-majors.  It is posted here for easy deployment to the College Shiny Server, and for to provide examples for colleagues to use and modify.

Some apps were written a while back when I was just learning my way around Shiny.  They will be re-factored someday; in the meantime I don't recommend emulating their coding strategies.

Reasonably good code can be found in:

* CIMean (explore confidence interval using simulation)
* FindRegLine (regression line game that records students' scores)
* GetToKnow (survey app, souped up with Google maps and basic descriptive statistics)

A tutorial on writing Shiny teaching apps can be found at:
